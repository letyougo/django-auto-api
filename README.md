# Django Auto API

**Web APIs for Django, with one line of code.**

**Author:** Tom Christie, [Follow me on Twitter][1].

## Overview

Django Auto API is an incredibly simple app that gives you a fully hyperlinked read-only API for all installed models in `html`, `json`, `yaml`, `xml` and `csv`. 
It only requires one line of code to be added to your project.

It is intended to demonstrate how `django-serializers` can easily be used to build web APIs.  In particular, it shows that customizing how model relations are represented allows you to do powerful things such as using hyperlinking to represent relationships, rather than using the default primary key representation.

## Requirements

Requires `django-serializers`, which currently requires Django 1.4.

## Installation

Install using pip:

    pip install django-auto-api

Add the `django-auto-api` urls to your URLConf:

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^api/', include('autoapi.urls', namespace='autoapi')),
    )

## End result

## Running the example project

If you've cloned the project from the git repo, you can run a very simple example project:

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py loaddata testfixture.json
    ./manage.py runserver

This runs an example API for a few models of `contrib.contenttypes` and `contrib.auth`.
